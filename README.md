# isotherm_sim_che_537

This is a project to showcase the utility of thermodynamic simulations to test adsorption properties of gasses in nano-porous solids, IE via the Henry coefficients. 

## Using Pluto.jl
* run `iso_sim.jl`
    * this Pluto notebook generates the henry coefficients via experimental data found in literature and compares to simulated data.

 ### data folder
 * This folder contains equilibrium adsorption isotherm csv files used to extract the Henry coefficients for metal-organic framework UIO-66.


## Usage example
* TODO
